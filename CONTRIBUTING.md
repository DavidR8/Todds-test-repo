# How to contribute

We're really glad you're reading this, because we need developers to help this project come to fruition.

If you haven't already, come find us on gitter.im ([BCDevExchange-app](https://gitter.im/BCDevExchange/BCDevExchange-app)) and join the chat. We are excited you are here and we want you working on things you're excited about too.

## Pay for pull

We are using a "pay for pull" model for some of the issues in this repository. That means that we associate a flat dollar amount that is payable upon merge of an associated pull request. These particular issues are labelled with a "Rapid Adoption" tag as well as a tag indicating the Canadian dollar amount associated with the merge.

By submitting a pull request on a "pay for pull" issue you accept the [Terms and Conditions](<<terms link>>). Detailed instructions on how to participate in the "pay for pull" model are [here](link to stuff).

Here are some important resources:

  * [Rapid Adoption Guide]() is where "pay for pull" is described in detail.
  * [Our Backlog]() is the detailed list of our work using waffle.io
  * [Gitter.im chat]() We're usually there during business hours.

## Testing

Our testbed consists of xxxxx. Please write tests for new code you create.

## Submitting changes

Please send a GitHub Pull Request with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). Please follow our [coding conventions]() and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

## Coding conventions

Start reading our code and you'll get the hang of it. We optimize for readability:

  * We indent using two spaces (soft tabs)
  * This is open source software. Consider the people who will read your code, and make it look nice for them. It's sort of like driving a car: Perhaps you love doing donuts when you're alone, but with passengers the goal is to make the ride as smooth as possible.

Thanks
